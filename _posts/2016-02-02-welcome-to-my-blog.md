# Welcome to this blog.


I've just started this blog. 
I've been learing about Github Pages for blogging because I want to collect a lot of information to see them again by blogging on Github.

![Github pages](http://moduslaborandi.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/github.pages.jpg)


And my former blog url is [Jiming's Blog](http://jiming.tistory.com/).

 

Thank you :)
